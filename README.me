CFG Assignment 1 - Git and GitHub
This repository will be used for the first assignent to demonstrate the use of Git commands

These are the stages I followed:

1. Created an empty repository on GitHub
2. Created a README file on VS code
3. Checked Git Status of this README - it is currently not being tracked
4. Initiated git on this file
5. Pushed the initial commit
6. Branched the file to continue making changes
